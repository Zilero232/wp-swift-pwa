## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers of this project pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing up with a willingness to collaborate

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness any unacceptable behavior, or have any concerns, please report it by contacting us at [sasha.artemev.1002@mail.ru]. All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, both online and offline, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team, who will review and investigate the incident. The project team may take action, including issuing a warning or banning the offending user.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, and we take violations of this Code of Conduct seriously.
